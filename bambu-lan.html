  <h1 class="title">Making Bambu Lab 3D printers usable offline</h1>
  <div class="date">Feb 12, 2025</div>
  <div class="text"><p>I recently got myself a Bambu Lab A1 Mini 3D printer. It&rsquo;s a nice little machine, especially for people new to 3D printing (like myself). Based on reviews and my own experience so far, it seems like a solid option for beginners that doesn&rsquo;t require dumping a bunch of money upfront on something that might not end up being used all that often.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s one of many devices that are internet-connected first. Local usage is <a href="https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/issues/4512" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">an afterthought</a>. Given the history of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/3d-printers-print-break-on-their-own-due-to-cloud-outage/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">all the terrible decisions</a> that the company has made and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/bambu-lab-pushes-a-control-system-for-3d-printers-and-boy-did-it-not-go-well/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">continues making</a>, I&rsquo;m not particularly interested in letting this thing connect to the internet. Oh, and it has a camera!</p>

<p>Aside from the obvious switch to LAN only mode, I wanted to take this a step further to regain some of the functionality that you end up losing from their official toolchain.</p>

<h2 id="orca-slicer">Orca Slicer</h2>

<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Orca Slicer</a></strong> is a fork of the Bambu Studio, with several crucial improvements. For example, one of the nice enhancements that was <a href="https://github.com/SoftFever/OrcaSlicer/pull/8256" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">recently introduced</a> fixes a couple of really annoying issues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Bambu Studio simply wouldn&rsquo;t connect to the printer that&rsquo;s in a different VLAN than my computer without <a href="https://github.com/Rdiger-36/StudioBridge" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">some</a> <a href="https://github.com/AndreasSchwalb/babulabRelay" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">hacky</a> workarounds. I keep all the IoT devices on their own VLAN that&rsquo;s restricted from making connections outside of my network.</p></li>

<li><p>It kept asking for the &ldquo;access code&rdquo; after restarting the slicer. So I had to keep it handy, ready to paste whenever it asks. Why can&rsquo;t it be saved? ðŸ¤·</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Incompetence is staggering, considering how good the hardware is. See this video for an easy-to-understand explanation of why their software is shit:</p>

<h2 id="home-assistant">Home Assistant</h2>

<p>Another set of features that you lose are notifications from Bambu Lab&rsquo;s official mobile app, and just the general ability to monitor your printer remotely. Both can be regained with <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Home Assistant</a>. If you are running it already, great! If not, you should consider using it for all your &ldquo;smart home&rdquo; stuff anyway.</p>

<p>The best way to connect HA with the printer is using this integration (available via HACS): <strong><a href="https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/greghesp/ha-bambulab</a></strong>. It includes support for a bunch of different entities that give a pretty comprehensive view of the state of your printer and allows controlling pretty much all features, except for initiating new prints.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wolfwithsword.com/bambulab-home-assistant-dashboard/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Create a dashboard</a> that&rsquo;s dedicated to 3D printing to monitor and control things remotely. Set up notifications to replace once which you&rsquo;d normally get from the official mobile app (examples below).</p>

<p><strong>Print completion notification:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Problem detection notification:</strong></p>
